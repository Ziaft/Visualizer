# Visualizer
It's a simple program to show how sorting algorithms operating writed using SFML.
## Building
Firstly, you need to install SFML from your package manager. Then make build directory, run **cmake** and then **make** or **cmake --build**.
For example:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```
If you using Windows, then tear it down and use Linux. It's a joke. Maybe. Anyway, you can download executable file with dll's and source code [here](https://github.com/Ziaft/VIsualizer/releases/tag/1.0).
